 * Why not just "SET NX, then handle"? A crash after the SET would make every retry look like a duplicate and the
 * event would be lost. Instead there are two states:
 *   processing  short lease, taken before the handler runs; expires by itself if the consumer dies
 *   done        written only AFTER the handler succeeded; kept for `retentionMs`
 *
 * Result: an event is never skipped unless it was really handled, and handled events are not handled again.
 *
 * Limit: the marker and the handler's own writes are separate Redis calls. A crash between them can run the
 * handler a second time for that one event. Closing that gap needs the marker written in the same atomic step as
 * the state change, which is what the current-state model (milestone 9) will do.
